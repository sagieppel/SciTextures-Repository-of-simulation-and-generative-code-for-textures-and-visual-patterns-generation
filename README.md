# SciTextures: Dataset of simulations and generative code for textures and visual-patterns generation
The SCITextures dataset is a large-scale collection of images featuring visual patterns and textures from a wide range of scientific and artistic domains, along with the corresponding models and generation code that produce them. The dataset spans over 1,270 distinct generative models, ranging from simple systems and mathematical functions, such as the Ising model and the Game of Life, to simulations of cities, materials, chemical reactions, biological growth, and many others. Each model is accompanied by standardized, flexible code that generates a given number of images at arbitrary resolutions, as well as 100 example images produced by the model. Most images are colored and seamlessly tileable, achieved through the use of periodic boundary conditions. In total, the dataset includes approximately 109,000 images. The dataset available under CC0 license.
