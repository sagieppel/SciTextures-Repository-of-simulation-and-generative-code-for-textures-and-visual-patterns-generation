# SciTextures: Dataset of simulations and generative code for textures and visual-patterns generation
The SciTextures dataset contains over 100,000 images of textures and visual patterns generated by various scientific models and simulations, combined with the code that generated these images. The models cover a wide range of scientific and artistic domains from physics, chemistry, biology, tech, and art. The dataset is free to use under the CC0 license.
